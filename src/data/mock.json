TLC is the most cost-effective method for rapid quantitative results in Food &amp; Beverage supporting a high level of quality and safety on products we eat and drink.</p>",

Products containing multiple APIs on the market range from multivitamins composed of 50 different compounds to complicated pharmaceutical dosage forms composed of just two. Combining multiple APIs can be as simple as a direct compression blend tableting process. However, it&rsquo;s not always that easy; not all APIs are compatible with one another and different release rates for different APIs may be desired. Additionally, particle sizes, densities, and other parameters vary and are critical to proper API function. Maintaining these critical material attributes while achieving proper content uniformity, stability, and robust high speed processing can be challenging or even impossible. A variety of different techniques and excipients are available for formulators to achieve these goals and combat challenging issues.</p>\r\n<p>In this webinar we will discuss:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Time tested, emerging, and favorite techniques for combining multiple APIs into a single dosage form</li>\r\n<li>Granulation</li>\r\n<li>Multi-particulate processing</li>\r\n<li>Direct compression techniques</li>\r\n<li>Multi-layer tableting</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We will also have a Q&amp;A session in which you will have the opportunity to share your own favorite techniques for combining multiple APIs into a single dosage form.<br /><br /><strong>Company Summary:<br /><br /></strong>JRS Pharma is a leading manufacturer of excipients, offering a complete portfolio of solutions for the global health science industry.

Using a rotor process technology, ethylcellulose can be applied to drug layered beads as a dry powder; enabling the user to achieve high levels of weight gain in a short period of time while still demonstrating sustained release.
